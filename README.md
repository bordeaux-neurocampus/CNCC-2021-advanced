# CNCC-2021-advanced
Computational Neuroscience Crash Course 2021 (advanced)

This repository serves as an announcement for next year's CNCC. Due to COVID-19 and the restrictions imposed on teaching in-person, this aspect is difficult to implement as it requires in-person supervision. The course for 2021 will be taught fully online and all the relevant material is hosted on the `(beginner)` repository.

We apologise for the inconvenience and we hope to see you in one of our future workshops!
